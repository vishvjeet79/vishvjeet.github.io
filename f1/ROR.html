<h1>COLREGs (Explained)</h1>
<article class="browser">
    <p><b> <span class="note" >PART  A - GENERAL</b> </span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><b> Rule 1 - Application</b> </p>
    <p>These Rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels.</p>
    <p2>Meaning: All ships big or small are to follow the rules. Small yachts, fishing vessels and other barges all as long they sail on the seas.
        All waters connected to the high sea include: major rivers, which have ports on their banks and which are visited by sea going vessels. All bays, and canals which are connected to the seas, provided that they are sailed on by ocean going vessels.
        </p2>
    <p> Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of special Rules made by an appropriate authority for roadsteads, harbours, rivers, lakes or inland waterways connected with the high seas and navigable by seagoing vessels. Such special Rules shall conform as closely as possible to these Rules.</b></p>
    <p2>Meaning: A harbour or port authority or a country may make some special rules for their port approaches or rivers or anchorage areas; in that case the COLREGS shall not cause confusion in having opposing view to the rules. However the rules that a country or port makes shall not be too dissimilar to the COLREGS</p2>
    <p>Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special Rules made by the Government of any state with respect to additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or with respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet.  These additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape or signal authorized elsewhere under these Rules. </p>
    <p2> Meaning: If a country has made any special rules which may make compulsory for ships and boats to show additional station or signals or lights for warships or for fishing fleets, then these special rules will again be such that they should not be confusing to a sea going vessel – that is they should not be similar to another signal in the COLREGS with a different meaning.</p2>
    <p>Traffic separation schemes may be adopted by the Organization for the purpose of these Rules. </p>
    <p2>Meaning: The IMO may decide at any time and place to impose a traffic separation scheme, which would make it easier to navigate in a major traffic area. The above Traffic Separation Schemes will be for the purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of these COLREGS. </p2>
    <p> Whenever the Government concerned shall have determined that a 	vessel of special construction or purpose cannot comply fully with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signaling appliances, such vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signaling appliances, as her Government shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules in respect of that vessel.</p>
    <p2>Meaning: If a specially constructed ship (aircraft carrier), which due to the nature of the equipment fitted does not have places where to fit the lights or shapes as required by the COLREGS as specified in the annexes, then a government may allow these special ships to carry their lights or shapes in a different place, but it shall make sure that these are the closest deviation from the COLREGS. That is they are almost similar to those fitted on regular ships. </p2>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><b> Rule 2 - Responsibility</b> </p>
    <p> (a)Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these Rules or of the neglect of any precaution, which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.</p>
    <p2> Meaning: There is no escaping the penalty of not following these rules. Everybody is responsible and no excuses are permitted that  forgot etc. Also there are some practices which are followed by seamen which may not be in the rules but they have been said and in use for many years, even these are included in compliance. This rule was formulated after all the ‘ordinary practice of seamen’ were written down as part of these rules, but some of the ‘ordinary practices’ which may have been overlooked are covered by this rule.
        Circumstances can dictate a deviation from these rules, like if the seaman thinks that by following the rules in a special situation the action would endanger the ships, in that case a deviation may be permitted which will not endanger the ships.
        </p2>
        <p>(b) In construing and complying with these Rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances including the limitations of the vessels involved which may make a departure from these Rules necessary to avoid immediate danger.</p>
        <p2>Meaning: In understanding and then complying with these rules pay close attention to the dangers of navigation and to the circumstances which may arise where blindly following these rules may endanger the ships.
            For this if required by common sense that to follow the rules would make a situation worse, then an action may be taken which are different from these rules but would have ensured safety for the vessels.
             </p2>
             <p><br></p>
             <p><b> Rule 3 - General Definitions</b> </p>
             <p>For the purpose of these Rules except where the context otherwise requires: - </p>
             <p>The world “vessel” includes every description of watercraft including non-displacement craft and seaplanes used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water. </p>
             <p2> Meaning: All types of craft that float on water and are used as a means of transportation. Also included are crafts, which do not displace water – such as hovercrafts. A seaplane when on the water displaces water so as long as it is on the surface of water it is considered as a vessel. All barges are also included since no propulsion system has been mentioned in this part of the Rule.</p2>
             <p>The term “power driven vessel” means any vessel propelled by machinery. </p>
             <p2>Meaning: Power here means power obtained from machinery, such as diesel engines, from the smallest to the largest, sailing vessels are not included as long as they are purely under sail, vessels under oars are also not included.  </p2>
             <p>The term “sailing vessel” means any vessel under sail provides that propelling machinery, if fitted is not being used. </p>
             <p2>Meaning: Sailing vessels of today rely to some form of machinery propulsion, that is when the wind is calm and the sailing vessel is not moving the sailing vessels (some of them) have provision for use of their main engine and propeller. So as long as this main engine on sailing vessels is not used they are termed as sailing vessels, the moment their main engine is started they are termed as power driven vessels, even if they hoist sails.       </p2>
             <p>The term “vessel engaged in fishing” means any vessel fishing with nets, lines, trawls or other fishing apparatus which restrict maneuverability, but does not include a vessel fishing with trolling lines or other fishing apparatus which do not restrict maneuverability. </p>
             <p2>Meaning: Fishing vessels means vessels actually fishing and which due to their equipment in the water are unable to move away and keep clear of other vessels. If the fishing vessel is not fishing or is using equipment, which does not restrict their taking evasive, action for safety then they are not termed as fishing vessels. The equipment as specified under the Rules is nets, lines (long line tuna fishing), trawls or other equipment, which are similar. </p2>
             <p>The word “seaplane” includes any aircraft designed to maneuver on the water. </p>
             <p2>Meaning: Obvious meaning, an aircraft which in an emergency is landing (ditching) in the water would not be termed as a seaplane, only those planes which by their construction and purpose can safely land, take off and manouevre to a pier or jetty are called seaplanes. </p2>
             <p>The term “vessel not under command” means a vessel which through some exceptional circumstances is unable to manouevre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel. </p>
             <p2>Meaning: Here a vessel not under command means any vessel, which because of some reason cannot keep out of the way of other vessels. Like ME breakdown and she cannot anchor, steering failure, launching a rescue boat or a lifeboat. </p2>
             <p>The term “vessel restricted in her ability to manouevre” means a vessel which from the nature of her work is restricted in her ability to manouevre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel. </p>
             <p2> Meaning: This includes a ship which is doing some special work by which she can move only in one direction say ahead, but cannot alter her course to take evasive action neither can she slow down or speed up to avoid a collision then in that case the vessel would be restricted in her ability to manoeuvre.
                The following are the vessels as declared under these Rules to be vessels restricted in their ability to manouevre, however this list is not absolute and final, this is a general guidance for such vessel, any vessel other than those in the list may also be ‘vessels restricted in their ability to manouevre’.
                 </p2>
                 <p> The term “vessels restricted in their ability to manouevre” shall include but not limited to:-</p>
                 <p>     i.      a vessel engaged in laying, servicing or picking up a navigational 	mark, submarine cable or pipeline;</p>
                 <p>   ii.      A vessel engaged in dredging, surveying or underwater operations; </p>
                 <p>    iii.      A vessel engaged in replenishment or transferring persons, provisions or 	cargo while underway;</p>
                 <p>   iv.      A vessel engaged in the launching or recovery of aircraft; </p>
                 <p>    v.      A vessel engaged in mine clearance operations; </p>
                 <p>vi.      A vessel engaged in a towing operation such as severely restricts the towing vessel and her tow in their ability to deviate from their course. </p>
                 <p2>Meaning: shall include but not limited to, this means that the Rules define the following vessels as being restricted in their ability to manoeuvre, but the classification of ships is not limited by the vessels already described, other vessels may also be included if they are also restricted in their ability to manoeuvre. </p2>
                 <p>The term “vessel constrained by her draught” means a power driven vessel, which, because of her draught in relation to the available depth and width of navigable water, is severely restricted in her ability to deviate from the course she is following. </p>
                 <p2> Meaning: This is applicable to POWER DRIVEN VESSELS, which because of their draft in comparison to the depth of water at that place is so great that she cannot alter to avoid a collision since to do that they would run aground.
                    However if there were adequate width of the channel through which they are moving then they would not be classed as constrained by draught.Thus a VLCC with a draft of 18m would be classed as a ‘vessel constrained by her draught’ in a channel where the least depth is 21m (3 m safety for squat etc) and the width of the channel is just 600 metres, but in the Pacific she would be an ordinary vessel.
                    If the channel or bay is such that all over the bay the depth is as mentioned but the size of the bay is 30NM by 40NM then she would not be a ‘vessel constrained by her draft’.
                    </p2>
                    <p> The word “underway” means that a vessel is not at anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.</p>
                    <p2>Meaning: This term is somewhat vague. The opinion has been held that a vessel, which is intentionally, anchored with a proper anchor and intends to hold her position, is anchored. But if the vessel ha dropped her anchor to turn the vessel in a tide or is dredging meaning that the anchor has been dropped underfoot and the vessel is being dragged or is under her own power and is steaming astern (the anchor helps in keeping the bow in line) then in these cases the vessel would not be termed as at anchor.
                        If the vessel drags her anchor and moves away then too she is not at anchor.
                        Thus the meaning of at anchor means in relation to the made fast to shore and aground that is the ship cannot move or drift away.
                         </p2>
                         <p>The words “length” and “breadth” of a vessel means her overall length and her greatest breadth. </p>
                         <p2> Meaning: Here LBP does not mean he length. </p2>
                         <p>Vessels shall be deemed to be in sight of one another only when one can be observed visually from the other. </p>
                         <p2>Meaning: The vessel being observed should be capable of being seen with the observers eyes and not by any electronic device, this is so because the aspect of the vessel is very important, the human brain analyses data from input more effectively than a electronic device. A change in other vessels heading is very readily apparent when observing visually, by electronic means it has a time lag. </p2>
                         <p>The term “restricted visibility” means any condition in which visibility is restricted by fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, sandstorms or any other similar causes. </p>
                         <p2>Meaning: Restricted visibility may be caused by any of the above conditions and also by any other means, for example the smoke from forest fires in the Indonesian forests had drastically reduced visibility in the Malacca Straits some years back. </p2>
                        </article> 
                        <article class="browser">
                            <p><b> <span class="note" >Part B - Steering and Sailing Rules</b> </span></p>
                            <p><b>Section 1-  Conduct of Vessels in any Condition of Visibility</b> </p>
                                <p><br></p>
                                <p><b> Rule 4 - Application</b> </p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p2>Meaning: The above section applies to all vessels and under any condition of visibility that is good visibility as well as when under poor visibility whatever the cause may be  </p2>
                                <p><b> Rule 5 - Look-out</b></p>
                                <p> Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.</p>
                                <p2>Meaning: Look out is very important and should take about 70 – 80% of the watch keeping officers time. The rest are to be the full appraisal of what he sees, and the action that is taken by him. Lookout is also for getting the feedback on the action that he or the other ship took to avoid the situation. 
                                    Look out means to see and understand the situation, by sight and hearing as well by other means which may be by Radar and GPS (position) and by any other electronic devices.
                                    Appropriate in the prevailing conditions means – in condition of poor visibility, the Radar and ears may be the only means of detecting other vessels, here again the range scale selection should be appropriate, if the vessel is in the middle of a fishing fleet there is no point keeping a watch on 12Nm range and only on one Radar. If 2 Radars exist then one should be set on smaller range and the other on 12Nm for detecting other vessels, if only 1 Radar is available then periodic switches have to be done between smaller scale and a longer scale.
                                    In any case the echo sounder the log the GPS and the chart and vessels charted position have to be also monitored. Because for a full appraisal of the situation all factors have to be taken into consideration, can the own vessel alter to keep out of the way or is it better to slow down.
                                     </p2>
